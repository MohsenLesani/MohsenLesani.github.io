<p>Fault-tolerant replicated database systems consume significantly less
energy than the compute-intensive proof-of-work blockchain. Thus, they
are promising technologies for the building blocks that assemble global
financial infrastructure. To facilitate global scaling, clustered
replication protocols are essential in orchestrating nodes into clusters
based on proximity. However, the existing approaches often assume a
homogeneous and fixed model in which the number of nodes across clusters
is the same and fixed, and often limited to a fail-stop fault model.
This paper presents heterogeneous and reconfigurable clustered
replication for the general environment with arbitrary failures. In
particular, we present Hamava, a fault-tolerant reconfigurable
geo-replication that allows dynamic membership: replicas are allowed to
join and leave clusters. We formally state and prove the safety and
liveness properties of the protocol. Furthermore, our replication
protocol is consensus-agnostic, meaning each cluster can utilize any
local replication mechanism. In our comprehensive evaluation, we
instantiate our replication with both HotStuff and BFT-SMaRt.
Experiments on geo-distributed deployments on Google Cloud demonstrate
that members of clusters can be reconfigured without affecting
transaction processing, and that heterogeneity of clusters may
significantly improve throughput.</p>
