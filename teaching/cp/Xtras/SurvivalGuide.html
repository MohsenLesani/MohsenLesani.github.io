<h2>Homework 2+3 Survival Guide</h2>

For those who want less than the full challenge in Homework 2+3,
we have two easily-defined avenues that can give a satisfying experience
and partial credit:
<ul>
<li> The basic challenge:  implement the homework for only the MainClass; 
     don't implement the homework for the TypeDeclarations.
<li> A bigger challenge:   implement the homework for the MainClass and
     the ClassDeclarations; 
     don't implement the homework for the ClassExtendsDeclarations.
</ul>
Other subsets of MiniJava will give partial credit too.
