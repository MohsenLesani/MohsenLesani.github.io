<p class="emph">
I have positions for motivated students. I will be glad to hear about your interests and accomplishments.
</p>

I am an associate professor at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of the University of California, Santa Cruz. I was a postdoc at MIT, obtained my PhD from UCLA, my MS in artificial intelligence from Sharif University of Technology and my BS in software engineering from University of Tehran. My research interests are reliability and security of software systems especially concurrent and distributed systems. Our recent focus is on secure replicated systems and distributed machine learning. I received the NSF CAREER award in 2020 and DARPA YFA award in 2022. My research has been recognized as SIGPLAN Research Highlight in 2019, received the distinguished paper award at OOPSLA 2018 and has been supported by multiple NSF grants.

# Projects

Here are some of our current and past projects:

- **Resilient and secure distributed systems**
Given resiliency requirements (confidentiality, integrity and especially availability policies) for an online service, how can we automatically partition, place and replicate it to ensure resiliency?
[S&P'22](companion/sp22/)

- **Heterogeneous and reconfigurable secure distributed systems**
How can we replicate online services on untrusted, heterogeneous, and dynamic hosts?
[DISC'23](companion/disc23/),  [DISC'24](companion/disc24/),  [ICDE'25](companion/icde25/)

- **Automatic analysis and synthesis of replicated objects**
Given a data type or a database and its integrity properties, how can we automatically decide the optimum hybrid consistency, and synthesize a custom replicated store that guarantees convergence and integrity? How can we accelerate hybrid consistency on message passing, RDMA and FPGA networks?
[POPL'19](companion/popl19/),  [CAV'20](companion/cav20/),  [PLDI'22](companion/pldi22/),  [OOPSLA'25](companion/oopsla25/)

- **Verification of distributed systems**
How can we modularly build a certified stack of distributed components?
[POPL'16](companion/popl16/),  [ICFP'20](companion/icfp20/)

- **Data analytics**
Given high-level analytics queries in domain specific languages, how can we automatically optimize and synthesize efficient parallel and distributed workflows?
[ICFP'21](companion/icfp21/)

- **Secure exchange**
How can we securely and efficiently execute transactions across multiple blockchains?
[ICBC'20](companion/icbc20/),  [PODC'21](companion/podc21/),  [CSF'23](companion/csf23/)

- **Machine learning for performance models**
Can we learn performance characteristics of data structures and leverage it to synthesize efficient data structures?
[MAPL'20](companion/mapl20/)

- **Domain-specific languages and type systems**
Can the safety guarantees of type systems carry over to safety of lab-on-a-chip assays?
[OOPSLA'18](companion/oopsla18/),  [CACM'21](companion/cacm21/CACM21.pdf)

- **Automatic fence insertion for concurrent systems**
Given high-level required orders between instructions of the concurrent program in each thread, can we optimize and automate the subtle task of fence placement?
[OOPSLA'15](companion/oopsla15/),  [PODC'17](companion/podc17/),  [DISC'19](companion/disc19/)

- **Concurrency programming models, testing and verification**
How can we design and implement intuitive, efficient and correct concurrent programming models, and data structures?
[PPoPP'11](downloads/Papers/PPoPP11.pdf),  [CONCUR'12](companion/concur12/index.html),  [DISC'13](companion/disc13/index.html),  [DISC'14](companion/disc14/),  [CAV'14](companion/cav14/),  [NFM'19](companion/nfm19/),  [OOPSLA'22](companion/oopsla22/)
